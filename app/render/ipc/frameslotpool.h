/**
 * @brief A fixed-size pool of equal-sized frame slots in shared memory, with lock-free hand-off.
 *
 * One pool models a single direction of frame flow (e.g. worker -> main for rendered output, or
 * main -> worker for decoded input). Ownership of a slot is transferred via two SPSC ring buffers
 * of slot indices, so no mutex is ever taken:
 *
 *   - free_ring:  indices of slots available to the FILLER. The drainer returns slots here.
 *   - ready_ring: indices of slots holding a published frame, produced by the FILLER for the
 *                 DRAINER to consume.
 *
 * Lifecycle (filler = producer of frames, drainer = consumer of frames):
 *   filler:  Acquire() -> pop a free index -> write meta + pixels -> Publish() -> push to ready
 *   drainer: Consume() -> pop a ready index -> read meta + pixels -> Release() -> push to free
 *
 * Because each ring has exactly one producer and one consumer (the filler owns free.Pop +
 * ready.Push, the drainer owns ready.Pop + free.Push), the SPSC invariant holds and the whole
 * exchange is lock-free.
 *
 * All slots are sized to `slot_data_bytes`, computed for the maximum supported frame (e.g. 8K RGBA
 * half-float). Frames smaller than that simply use a prefix of the slot.
 *
 * The pool does NOT own the memory; it is constructed over a SharedMemoryRegion mapping. Use
 * BytesNeeded() to size that region.
